# Exploring NYC Public School Test Result Scores

## Project Overview

This project aims to explore and analyze standardized test performance data from New York City's public schools. The analysis will help identify schools with top math results, examine performance variations by borough, and find the top ten performing schools in the city. This project is part of a premium DataCamp course focused on data manipulation and summary statistics.

## Project Description

Every year, school test results play a crucial role in determining the college admissions fate of millions of students. In this project, we leverage publicly available test score data to uncover insights about school performance across New York City. Our primary focus is on identifying top-performing schools in math, analyzing how performance varies across different boroughs, and compiling a list of the top ten performing schools in the city.

### Objectives:
1. **Identify Top Math Results:** Find schools with the best math performance in NYC.
2. **Performance by Borough:** Analyze how school performance varies by borough (Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, Bronx, Staten Island).
3. **Top Ten Schools:** Identify the top ten performing schools based on test results.

## Data Source

The dataset used for this analysis is publicly available and contains standardized test scores for NYC public schools. It includes data on:
- **School Name**
- **Borough**
- **Average Math Score**
- **Average Reading Score**
- **Average Writing Score**

## Data Analysis Techniques

In this project, we apply various data manipulation techniques and summary statistics, including:
- **Data Cleaning:** Removing any missing or irrelevant data.
- **Aggregation:** Grouping data by borough to compute summary statistics.
- **Standard Deviation:** Calculating the standard deviation to measure the variation in performance.
- **Ranking:** Ranking the schools by performance in math.

## Tools and Libraries Used

- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization .
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For conducting the analysis in an interactive environment.
